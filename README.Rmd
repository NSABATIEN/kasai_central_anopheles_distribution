# Vic's Roadmap objective 1

“This roadmap outlines the key steps to be completed for Objective 1, which focuses on geospatial modeling of vector species distribution across Kasaï-Central.”

## Step 1 : Load packages (done)
1.1. Load all packages required
## Step 2 : Read in KC data (done)
2.1. Define a path and find the latest Excel file (done)
2.2. Read in Excel sheets and clean the data (done)
2.3. Clean and summarize collection data (done)
2.4. Clean and summarize location data (done)
2.5. Join collection data and location data (done)
2.6. Preliminary Spatial visualization and quality check (done)
## Step 3 : Prepare environmental covariates (in progress)
3.1. Download environmental covariates (done)
- Bioclimatic variables downloaded in geodata package using WorldClim function
- Landcover layers downloaded in geodata package using global_landcover function
3.2. Crop both covariates (climate and landcover) to the extend around KC (not yet/need support to define )
3.3. Link both covariates (climate and landcover) to location data (not yet)
3.4. Plot the landcover _crop (not yet)

## Step 4 : Fit the model (binomial model for presence/absence data, or poisson model for count data) " not yet" 

## Step 5 : Model Diagnostics Using DHARMa  "not yet"

## Step 6 : Loading model and conducting env_ (MESS) "not yet"
